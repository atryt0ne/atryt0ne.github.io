# About this blog
  Hey! I'm Aniruddh Pramod. And this is my little corner on the internet. I do some ML stuff. It's pretty fun sometimes.
  I don't really do maintenance, so don't expect frequent updates here.
  Random stuff will probably end up here. Projects I work on? Things I find interesting? Shitty poetry? Not so shitty stories? All here.
  Poke around if you like.

  Here's my resume, if you want a more traditional overview though - [resume](./uploads/resume.pdf)
